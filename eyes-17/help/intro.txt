Connect PV1 to A1, change PV1 using slider and watch A1 changing. Try with PV2 & A2
Connect different capacitors between IN1 to Ground and measure them.
Measure Resistors (Accuracy is less for values < 100 Ohm and > 100 kOhm)
Connect SQ1 to IN2 and measure the frequency. Change it using slider and measure again.
Connect 1000 Ohms from CCS (1.1mA) to ground, Connect CCS to A1. Enable CCS and note the voltage
