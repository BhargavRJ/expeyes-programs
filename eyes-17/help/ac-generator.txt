A rotating magnet causes a rotating magnetic field also.
Placing a coil in that field will induce a periodic voltage across it.
Use the DC motor to rotate the magnet. The coils are provided with ExpEYES.
The frequency of the induced AC will be the number of rotations per second of the magnet.
The phase difference between the two signal depends upon the angle between the axes of the coils
