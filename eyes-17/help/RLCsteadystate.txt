Choose C = 1uF and L = 10 mH. Set the frequency to around 1600 Hz, 
adjust it to make to make the voltage across LC (blue trace) minimum.
It will not become zero due to the resistance of the inductor (20 Ohm).
Toggle the "Show Vcap & Vind" switch to view the voltage across L and C,
they are out of phase at resonance.
